When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">release early, release often (RERO) software development philosophy</a> on Wikipedia for more information on the benefits of smaller / more frequent releases.</p>

* {bugfix} = Backwards-compatible bug fixes or small improvements.
