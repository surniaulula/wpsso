<img src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/assets/icon-256x256.png" style="width:33%;min-width:128px;max-width:256px;height:auto;float:left;margin:10px 60px 40px 0;" />

<p><strong>WPSSO uses your <em>existing</em> content to generate meta tags and Schema markup</strong> &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional settings or values, but if you want to, you can customize just about anything and everything. ;-)</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO creates <em>complete</em> and <em>accurate</em> social meta tags and Schema markup</strong> &mdash; including titles, descriptions, hashtags, images, videos, ecommerce product details, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, ratings, event details, recipe information, and much more &mdash; all from your <em>existing</em> content.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO provides all the information social websites and search engines need</strong> &mdash; improving social engagement, Google Search ranking, and click-through-rates on Facebook, Google Search / Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and many more.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO includes special support and optimization features for Pinterest</strong> &mdash; providing customized Pinterest image sizes, and avoiding conflicts between incompatible Pinterest and Facebook Open Graph meta tags.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO offers a <em>fast</em> and <em>reliable</em> framework for developers and advanced users</strong> &mdash; offering dozens of 3rd party integration modules in the Pro version, several Free and Pro extensions, and hundreds of filter hooks to easily customize WPSSO's behavior and output.</p>
