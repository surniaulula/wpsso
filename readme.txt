Make sure social websites present your content correctly, no matter how your webpage is shared - from buttons, browser add-ons, or pasted URLs.

== Description ==

<p><img src="https://ps.w.org/wpsso/assets/icon-256x256.png?rev=" style="width:33%;min-width:128px;max-width:256px;float:left;margin:0 40px 20px 0;" /><strong>Make sure social websites present your content in the best possible way, no matter <em>how</em> your webpage is shared</strong> &mdash; from sharing buttons on the webpage, browser add-ons and extensions, or URLs shared directly in social timeline posts and <em>private messages</em>.</p>

= Advanced Social Management =

<p>WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO) <strong>gives you total control over the information social website crawlers need</strong>, improving Google Search ranking, social engagement, and click-through-rates on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, StumbleUpon, Tumblr and and many more &mdash; no sharing buttons required!</p>

<p><strong>Extend or replace your current SEO solution</strong> &mdash; Google Search reads social meta tags and <em>Knowledge Graph</em> markup, so many users are choosing to extend or even replace their current SEO solution with WPSSO.</p>

<p><strong>Already have social sharing buttons?</strong> No problem! Sharing buttons <em>only submit URLs</em> to social websites &mdash; WPSSO includes all the information those social website crawlers need to properly share and display your content. <strong>Use WPSSO by itself or in combination with any of your favorite social sharing buttons</strong>.</p>

<p>You can download the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">Free version of WPSSO on wordpress.org</a> and <a href="http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/">purchase Pro license(s) on surniaulula.com</a> (includes a <strong>No Risk 30 Day Refund Policy</strong>).</p>

<h4>Industry Reviews</h4>

<p>"<em>If you want to make every tweet, like, share, pin, and +1 count, then you should definitely start using WPSSO on your WordPress site.</em>" &mdash; <a href="http://www.indexwp.com/wordpress-social-sharing-optimization-pro-review/">indexwp.com</a></p>

<p>"<em>I’m now a customer. This plugin is invaluable and a real time saver. The fact that it won’t slow my site down either is something that also sold me on it.</em>" &mdash; <a href="http://www.wpkube.com/wpsso-plugin-review/">wpkube.com</a></p>

<p>"<em>Wherever you are at with the social media marketing strategy for your site, the WP Social Sharing Optimization plugin can help you get better results.</em>" &mdash; <a href="http://wplift.com/wordpress-social-sharing-optimization">wplift.com</a></p>

<p>"<em>If you want to get the most out of the social shares your content receives, ensure your content stands out when it is posted on the various social networks, and listed in the search engines, then this plugin is a great choice that covers all the bases.</em>" &mdash; <a href="http://www.wpmayor.com/wordpress-social-sharing-optimization-pro-plugin-review/">wpmayor.com</a></p>

<p>"<em>WPSSO Pro provides a handy tool for your marketing team, and improves your content whenever it’s shared by you or your fans. The free version has a lot of great features and makes a good trial version, but I think that eCommerce sites really benefit from the eCommerce plugin and video integrations (as well as the inclusion of Twitter card support) that the Pro version offers.</em>" &mdash; <a href="http://www.sellwithwp.com/optimized-social-media-wpsso-plugin-review/">sellwithwp.com</a></p>

<img src="https://ps.w.org/wpsso/assets/screenshot-22.png?rev=" style="width:50%;min-width:256px;max-width:607px;float:right;margin:0 0 20px 40px;" />

WordPress Media Library images (and NextGEN Gallery in the Pro version) are resized according to their intended audience (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc). The Pro version also detects embedded videos from Slideshare, Vimeo, Wistia, and Youtube (including their preview images).

WPSSO (Pro version) also includes support for [JetPack Photon](http://jetpack.me/support/photon/) and [NextGEN Gallery v1 and v2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) albums, galleries and images (shortcodes, image tags, album / gallery preview images, etc.).

<strong>Enhanced SEO</strong>

WPSSO (Pro version) integrates with [WordPress SEO by Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/), [All in One SEO Pack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/), and [HeadSpace2 SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/headspace2/) &mdash; making sure your custom SEO settings are reflected in the Open Graph, Rich Pin, and Twitter Card meta tags.

<h4>Social Profiles for Google Search</h4>

WPSSO provides <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/customize/social-profiles">author (Person) and publisher (Organization) social profiles markup in schema.org JSON-LD format for Google Search and their <em>Knowledge Graph</em></a>. The author (Person) markup includes the author's website URL, their profile social sharing image, and all listed contact URLs from their user profile. The publisher (Organization) markup includes the website URL, a corporate logo, a default image, and the publisher Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter business pages.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

= Complete Social Meta Tags =

WPSSO adds Facebook / [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/), [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), and [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and most social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, hashtags, images, videos, product, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). WPSSO uses the *existing* content of your webpages to build HTML meta tags &mdash; There's no need to manually enter / configure any additional values or settings (although many settings and options *are* available). <a href="http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/screenshots/">See examples from Google Search, Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, etc.</a> &mdash; along with screenshots of the WPSSO settings pages.

= Proven Performance =

WPSSO is *fast and coded for performance*, making full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching). WPSSO loads only the library files and object classes it needs, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

= Clean Uninstall =

Try the WPSSO plugin with complete confidence &mdash; when uninstalled, WPSSO removes *all* traces of itself from the database (options, site options, user and post meta, transients, etc.).

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

= Professional Support =

WPSSO support and development is on-going. You can review the [FAQ](http://faq.wpsso.surniaulula.com/) and [Notes](http://notes.wpsso.surniaulula.com/) pages for additional setup information. If you have any suggestions or comments, post them to the [WordPress support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wpsso) or the [Pro version support website](http://support.wpsso.surniaulula.com/).

**We do not require WordPress admin access to support the plugin** &mdash; All support is provided from the front-end using HTML debugging information within the webpage (see the *Add Hidden Debug Messages* option on the SSO Advanced settings page).

== Changelog ==

<blockquote>
<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). 
New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. 
When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released.
This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>
