<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">release early, release often (RERO) software development philosophy</a> on Wikipedia for more information on the benefits of smaller / more frequent releases.</p>

<h3>Version Numbering</h3>

Version components: `{major}.{minor}.{bugfix}[-{stage}.{level}]`

* {major} = Major structural code changes and/or incompatible API changes (ie. breaking changes).hanges).
* {minor} = New functionality was added or improved in a backwards-compatible manner.
* {bugfix} = Backwards-compatible bug fixes or small improvements.
* {stage}.{level} = Pre-production release: dev &lt; a (alpha) &lt; b (beta) &lt; rc (release candidate).
