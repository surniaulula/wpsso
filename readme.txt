<strong>A solid social markup plugin is the foundation of any good social strategy</strong> &mdash; WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO) allows you to manage the information social websites need, improving <em>Google Search ranking</em>, <em>social engagement</em>, and <em>click-through-rates</em> on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and many more.</p>

WPSSO uses the existing content of your webpages to generate complete meta tags and Schema markup &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional values or settings.</p>

<blockquote id="changelog_top_info">
<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>
