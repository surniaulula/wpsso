<p>The following Setup Guide is a collection of suggestions and hints to help you get started with the WPSSO plugin. WPSSO works great "<em>right out of the box</em>" and you may decide to keep the default settings as-is, but taking a few minutes to review the settings will help maximize your social presence and click-through rate.</p>

<p>WPSSO is also a mature and very flexible social framework. Developers are invited to use the <a href="http://wpsso.com/codex/plugins/wpsso/notes/developer/">Developer Resources</a> and take advantage of our <a href="http://wpsso.com/codex/plugins/wpsso/installation/developer-special-buy-one-get-one-free/">Free 2 for 1 Developer License</a>.</p>

<h3>WebSite Social Accounts</h3>
<p>Create a Facebook Page, Twitter account, and Google+ account (or Page) for your website / business (if you haven't already). You can enter your website's social accounts information on the WordPress <u>Settings &gt; Website / Business Social Accounts</u> page. The social account values are used by WPSSO for Google / SEO, Schema, Open Graph, and other meta tags -- including the publisher (Organization) social profiles markup in schema.org JSON-LD format. These social accounts may appear in Google Search results to highlight your website / business social pages.<p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Author Social Accounts</h3>
<p>Ask your authors to enter their Facebook, Google+, and Twitter contact information on their profile page. Each author's contact information can appear in various meta tags and schema.org JSON-LD markup -- but only if they complete their user profile. All URLs found in the author's contact methods will be listed in the author (Person) social profile markup for Google. Authors should take a moment to update their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=followers">Facebook Follower Settings</a> to enable a Follow button on Facebook. In this way, authors can publish both private (for friends) and public (for friends and followers) content on their Facebook wall.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Essential Settings</h3>
<p>Review the Site Description on the WPSSO <u>Essential Settings</u> page and select a Default / Fallback Image ID. WPSSO uses information from the first post on index / archive and search webpages. If you define a <em>Default Image ID</em> (or Default Image URL), WPSSO can use this image as a fallback in case a Post / Page does not contain a suitable image, and/or force the default image on index / archive and search webpages. See the WPSSO <u>General Settings &gt; Images</u> tab for these and other image related options.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Image Dimensions</h3>
<p>Review the WordPress <u>Settings &gt; Social Image Dimensions</u> values. If your original images are large enough, you should set the Open Graph image dimensions to 1200x1200px cropped or larger. Images that are 600px or wider are displayed more prominently on Facebook, and 1200px or wider is required to avoid up-scaling (stretching) images for retina / high PPI displays &mdash; so it's worth taking the time to make sure <em>all</em> your original / full-size featured images are at least 1200px in width <em>and</em> height, along with setting an Open Graph image dimension of 1200x1200px cropped.</p>
<p>The default Open Graph image dimensions are 600x600px cropped. You can reduce these values down to 200x200px, but Facebook will display small images as thumbnails in user timelines. The minimum recommended image dimensions value is 600x600px cropped &mdash; and for best results, use 1200px or wider. Most social websites, aside from Twitter and Google+ who use a different meta tag standard, will use the Open Graph image &mdash; 1200x1200px cropped is the most compatible dimension for all social sites, but if you're primarily concerned with Facebook, you should use 1200x630px cropped instead (this is Facebook's preferred image dimension).</p>
<p>If your original images are large enough, you can also double the default Twitter Card image dimensions from 600x600px to 1200x1200px, and from 300x300px to 600x600px. By offering larger images, you allow Twitter to provide higher resolution images for retina / high DPI displays.</p>

<h3>Validation Tools</h3>
<p>Submit a few sample Posts and Pages to the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/">Facebook Debugger</a></strong> to verify your Open Graph meta tags. A link to the Facebook Debugger is available under the Validate tab in the Social Settings metabox. Submitting a URL to the Facebook Debugger can also be used to clear Facebook's cache (after clicking the "Fetch new scrape information" button a few times).</p>
<p>Submit a Post / Page to the <a href="http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/validator/">Pinterest Rich Pin Validator</a> and request approval for Rich Pins. Pinterest Rich Pins are an extension of Open Graph meta tags, but the Rich Pin Validator can be a little buggy, so double check any errors with the Facebook Debugger to make sure they are actual / real errors.  Once approved, you can zoom a Pin to view its Rich Pin information.</p>
<p>Submit index / archive and Post / Page URLs to the <A href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a> to verify the HTML of your theme templates. Social crawlers expect properly coded HTML markup that conforms to current HTML / XHTML standards. If your webpages contain serious markup errors, social and/or search engine crawlers may be unable to parse your webpage content. Fix and/or report any template markup issues with your theme author. WPSSO uses &lt;noscript&gt; containers to include additional schema markup in webpage headers. The W3C validation tool may report errors for these meta tags. These errors can be safely ignored, or uncheck the "Use Meta Property Container(s)" option under the WPSSO <u>General Settings &gt; Google / Schema</u> tab.</p>
