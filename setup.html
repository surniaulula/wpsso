<p>The following Setup Guide is a collection of suggestions and hints to get you started with the WPSSO plugin. WPSSO works great "<em>right out of the box</em>" and you may decide to keep the default settings as-is, but modifying just a few options for your website will help to maximize your social presence and click-through rate.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:numeric">

<li>
<p><strong>Create a Facebook Page, Twitter account, and Google+ account (or Page) for your website / business</strong> (if you haven't already).</p>

<p>You can enter your website's social information on the <u>WordPress Settings &gt; Website / Business Social Accounts</u> page. The social account values are used for Google / SEO, Schema, Open Graph, and other meta tags -- including the publisher (Organization) social profiles markup in schema.org JSON-LD format. These social accounts may also appear in Google Search results to highlight your website / business social pages.<p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Ask your authors to enter their Facebook, Google+, and Twitter contact information on their profile page</strong>.</p>

<p>Each author's contact information can appear in various meta tags and schema.org JSON-LD markup -- but only if they complete their user profile. All URLs found in the author's contact methods will be listed in the author (Person) social profile markup. The author's "Twitter @username" is used to include a URL to their Twitter profile as well.</p>

<p>Authors should also take a moment to update their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=followers">Facebook Follower Settings</a> to enable a Follow button on their shared Facebook content. In this way, authors can publish both private (for friends) and public (for friends and followers) content on their Facebook wall.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Review the <u>WordPress Settings &gt; Social Image Dimensions</u> values</strong>.</p>

<p>If your original images are large enough, you should set the Open Graph image dimensions to 1200x1200px cropped or larger (see each option's help popup for more information on image dimensions). Images that are at least 600px wide will be displayed more prominently on Facebook, and 1200px is required to avoid up-scaling images for retina / high PPI displays &mdash; so it's worth taking the time to make sure that <em>all</em> your original / full-size featured images are at least 1200px in width <em>and</em> height, along with setting an Open Graph image dimension of 1200x1200px cropped.</p>

<p>The default Open Graph image dimensions values are 600x600px cropped. You can reduce these values down to 200x200px, but Facebook will display these images as thumbnails in timelines. The minimum recommended image dimensions value is 600x600px cropped &mdash; for best results, use 1200px wide images or larger. Aside from Twitter and Google+, most social sites will use the Open Graph image &mdash; 1200x1200px cropped is the most compatible dimension, but if you're primarily concerned with images on Facebook, you could choose 1200x630px cropped instead (this is Facebook's preferred image dimension).</p>

<p>If your original images are large enough, you should also double the default Twitter Card image dimensions from 600x600px to 1200x1200px, and from 300x300px to 600x600px. By offering larger images, you will allow Twitter to provide higher resolution images for retina / high DPI displays.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Review all highlighted options (outlined in orange)</strong>.</p>

<p>WPSSO will use information from the first post on index / archive and search webpages. If you define a <em>Default Image ID</em> (or Default Image URL), WPSSO can use this image as a fallback in case a Post / Page does not contain a suitable image, and/or force the default image on index / archive and search webpages. See the <u>SSO &gt; General &gt; Images</u> tab for these and other image related options.</p>

<p>Additional highlighted options you may want to review include the <em>Default Article Topic</em> and <em>Site Description</em> (under the <u>Site Information</u> tab), <em>Facebook Admin Username(s)</em> and <em>Author Name Format</em> (under the <u>Facebook</u> tab), among several others.</p>

<p><strong>About the <u>Theme Integration</u> tab</strong>...</p>

<p>The <u>SSO &gt; Advanced &gt; Theme Integration</u> tab has a particularly important option that you should review. The <em>&lt;head&gt; Attributes Filter Hook</em> option is used to add schema markup to your webpage head element. WPSSO will check for a standard <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element in your theme template, and if found, will suggest an automated modification of your theme's header.php template. If you did not see this notice when installing or updating WPSSO &mdash; or you dismissed it without modifying you theme template &mdash; you should review the help popup for this option and make the necessary changes manually.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Submit a few sample Posts and Pages to the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/">Facebook Debugger</a></strong> to verify your Open Graph meta tags.</p>

<p>A link to the Facebook Debugger is available under the Validate tab in the Social Settings metabox. Submitting a URL to the Facebook Debugger can also be used to clear Facebook's cache (after clicking the "Fetch new scrape information" button a few times).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Submit a Post / Page to the <a href="http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/validator/">Pinterest Rich Pin Validator</a></strong> and request approval for Rich Pins.</p>

<p>Pinterest Rich Pins are an extension of Open Graph meta tags, but the Rich Pin Validator can be a little buggy, so double check any errors with the Facebook Debugger to make sure they are actual / real errors.  Once approved, you can zoom a Pin to view its Rich Pin information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Submit index / archive and post / page URLs to the <A href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a></strong> to verify your theme templates.</p>

<p>Social crawlers expect properly coded HTML markup that conforms to current HTML / XHTML standards. If your webpages contain serious markup errors, social and/or search engine crawlers may be unable to parse your webpage content. Fix and/or report any template markup issues with your theme author.</p>

<p>WPSSO is a powerful tool that can detect images and videos from a variety of sources (attached, featured, content, etc.), along with e-commerce product information. It's worth noting some of the most common questions, to get an idea of what it can do, and some of the issues that may come up. Some of the most relevant / popular ones might be:</p>
