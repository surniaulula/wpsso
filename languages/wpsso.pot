"WordPress allows themes and plugins to hook hundreds of different filters to "
"manage the Post / Page content (some of these filters are called by "
"WordPress to expand shortcodes, for example). WordPress generally calls a "
"filter (like 'the_content') once to expand text for a given post within the "
"loop or a single webpage. As a consequence, some authors mistakenly assume "
"that a filter they have created will only be executed once for a given post, "
"and only within the webpage body or specific area. WordPress filters are "
"available to any theme or plugin that needs to expand text (title, excerpt, "
"content, etc.), and in any context (header, loop, widget, admin, etc.). "
