"<strong>The difference between a cropped and uncropped image size is "

"will be resized so that both sides meet or exceed the image dimensions "
"requested, and the excess width or height will be trimmed. The resulting "
"image will match the required dimensions <em>exactly</em> (having sacrificed "
"parts of the image). When resizing without cropping, the original aspect "
"ratio is preserved and no parts of the image are sacrificed. The image will "
"be resized so that both the width and height will fit <em>within</em> the "

"Most social and search sites automatically crop images to fit within a "

"WPSSO Core Premium includes an optional module to allow upscaling of "

"example, a full size image of 100x200px could be upscaled up to 150x300px "
"using a maximum upscaling value of 50%, but trying to resize any larger than "
